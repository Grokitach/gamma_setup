	<string id="ls_tip_1">
		<text>Guns must be repaired to progress since you can't buy them from traders. Indeed, the EU and UN decided to put a stop at the bloodshed in the Zone as well as guns smuggling from the Zone to the nearby countries by trying to limit guns traffic, and no faction want to have problems with more Private Military Companies paid by these organisms, PMCs are already crawling enough within the Zone. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_2">
		<text>Gun's condition is separated from parts conditions. Gun condition represents how clean a gun is and will impact how fast parts degrade. Barrel condition affects ammo damage and penetration. Other parts condition will affect how often the gun jams. Parts can be swapped by drag and drop. The barrel needs appropriate tools to be changed. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_3">
		<text>Collect gun parts that are above 60% condition and repair them with the appropriate tool to 100% condition (ramrod, Multitool... Check the part's details). Drag and drop the repaired parts on a gun to change them, it will limit the chance of the gun jamming. Moving parts in and out of the gun will make it less clean. Barrels can't be replaced that way, you need the appropriate repair kit and use the vice menu or right-clicking the gun and "maintain parts". </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_4">
		<text>"Limiting guns traffic?! Tell that to politics when you have monolithans in front of you! Why do think Monolith is back after all these years?! Fuck the EU and UN!" - Illich Popov, Veteran Loner. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_5">
		<text>"Armors and helmets can be repaired by collecting and repairing parts above 50% condition and swapping them in the workbench menu (right-click any toolkit to open the workbench). You need the appropriate repair kit. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_6">
		<text>To progress quickly, perform tasks, kill mutants, collect their parts, keep these parts to accomplish stalkers tasks, collect stashes coordinates, visit those stashes, get fat loot, get toolboxes, repair the fat loot. Do tasks, get goodwill, sleep, visit traders, buy new shiny ammo for your juicy loot. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_7">
		<text>Use basic healing items like medkits or bandages to heal your main health. It will also heal your limbs temporarily (yellow HP). To convert these temporary HP to permanent HP for your limbs (yellow to white HP) use post heal items (like Ibuprofen, with white dots in their description). </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_8">
		<text>Crafting is essential to survive. Right-click any toolkit to "open workbench". From there you can access the craft menu where most recipes are already unlocked. Be sure disassemble armors and guns you don't need as well as items harboring a small gear on their icon to collect crafting items (harboring a pincer and a hammer icon). </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_9">
		<text>Holding Left Alt key on an item will reveal its stats when the item is repaired to 100% condition. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_10">
		<text>While acessing a container (chest, body...) Holding shift key while hovering an item will move it to the opposite window.  </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_11">
		<text>Ammunition can be quite heavy, but disassembled ammo parts are very lightweight: keep these parts and craft ammo on the go with your gunsmith toolkit. Be sure to disassemble all unnecessary ammo. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_12">
		<text>You can right click and mark some items as "Favorite" and others as "Junk". This will give you an easy access to the important items that will always be on the top of every inventory containers. It's the opposite for junk: it will always be at the bottom  of inventories. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_13">
		<text>You don't need every medical items to heal your body. Mark the most important ones as favorite for an easy access. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_14">
		<text>Water bottle are much better weight-wise than cantines to quench your thirst. Keep the cantines in your main stash to cook mutant food that is better than imported goods to feel your belly. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_15">
		<text>"Hello Stalker, you are new around here, right? No shiny ammunition for you, we don't trust you just yet... I see that you have that old PPSh from your grandfather don't you? Here are some 7.62x25 ammo, that's all you gonna get today. Now, go hunt these mutants and make the Zone a safer place." - Petrenko </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_16">
		<text>What the hell do you mean there’s no Coffee! You're telling me that we can import gallons of Vodka, Beer, sparkling water, and energy drinks, but I can't get some fucking Coffee beans in this God forsaken place? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_17">
		<text>Traders will mostly sell supplies and some accessories. You can increase their supply level by doing tasks for the trader's faction. The goodwill thresholds are: 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 goodwill. This is the main way to secure a constant income of good ammunitions. Check your PDA relation tab and "show number" to check your goodwill with all factions. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_18">
		<text>Traders are either of the WP (Warsaw Pact) or NATO type. This will influence the kind of supplies that they sell (ammo and attachments mostly). NATO factions: Mercenaries, Clear Sky, Freedom, UNISG. WP factions: Military, Loner, Duty, Bandits, Renegades, Monolith. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_19">
		<text>Some traders sell very specific items, like Prof. Sakharov and Hermann sell the Artefacts Melter, a specific toolkit that let's you empower and craft artefacts (and you can break artefacts with it to replenish the melter's power). They also sell exoskeletons' PSU recipes at high supply level. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_20">
		<text>Maintaining an exoskeleton armor is a money sink since you need to often buy expensive exo batteries in numbers... Or grab them from the cold bodies of your enemies. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_21">
		<text>You character will be tired at the end of the day. You have to sleep replenish your energy. You can only sleep if you are tired enough. Using sleeping pills will allow you to forcefully sleep. Drinking vodka and eating fat meals also help to sleep. On the contrary, caffeine tablets will make you stay awake later. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_22">
		<text>You'll have a chance to wake up early without good a sleeping equipement (sleeping bag and sleeping mat). If you sleep in "free" beds, be sure to try to sleep more than what you intend to, they are uncomfortable and other stalkers can be noisy and you'll wake up early. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_23">
		<text>Be sure to use appropriate ammo against a given target. Heavy armored stalkers will need high caliber AP ammo to be killed easily, while mutants hate HP and buckshots ammo. The latter might work on the average bandits, but not on Monolith Nosorogs exos. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_24">
		<text>You'll get random messages that are telling you to find some packages in certain areas. To find them, equip your RF Receiver and press the detector key. Put your weapon away and start changing the frequency of the RF Receiver to match the one from the message using your mouse buttons and shift key. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_25">
		<text>Stashes must be marked to contain anything. Unmarked stashes will always be empty. Stashes content is tied to the map they spawn in: the northern a stash is in the Zone, the better the loot. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_26">
		<text>Storing stuff in stashes is safe: it won't be looted by other stalkers and even if the stash is marked at some point, content will spawn in the stash on top of what you previously stored. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_27">
		<text>To cook you don't necessarily need coal, just stand near a firecamp and open the cooking menu from cooking kits, if it does not work, stand closer to the firecamp. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_28">
		<text>Artefacts spawn in low "condition", they are just almost useless rocks slightly bending the law of physics. However, you can empower them by fusing two artefacts of the same kind using the Artefacts Melter that can buy from Prof. Sakharov to make them much stronger and actually defy the law of physics... </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_29">
		<text>The Artefacts Melter that you can buy from Ecologists is able to fuse different artefacts to generate new, stronger ones. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_30">
		<text>"Sir why are you shooting the zombies? Command gave us clear orders to grab the target and prepare for extract asap." "These were once people who had hopes, dreams, jobs, and everything else we do. Now they are just walking corpses living in constant pain and suffering. It is a fate worse than death and if that happens to me, I hope you will do the same."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_31">
		<text>Wearing other factions armors allows you to be considered as a member of that faction if the patch of the faction's armor is on. Don't push your luck though, if get too close, stalkers will see through your trick. Tear the patch off to identify as your own faction. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_32">
		<text>Radiations will slowly reduce your health and will reduce your max stamina. The more irradiated you are, the more probably critical organs will be damaged by radioactive particles. This results in the bad coughs and severe injuries. Wear an adapted gas mask depending on the area you are heading. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_33">
		<text>The more to the north you go, the more dangerous the radiations will be. Be sure to have a proper gas mask before going into northern areas. Army Warehouses without a gas mask can kill you if you just hit one bad radiation patch without proper anti radiation medication. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_34">
		<text>Whoever told you the Monolith are just braindead lunatics is just as foolish as they are. They have more structure and organization then then Duty or the military. They have ranks, rituals, and are insanely well armed. It is their commitment to the Monolith they guard that makes them so scary and "lunatics."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_35">
		<text>Everything was going so smoothly until we heard the metal ping of a bullet ripping through the sarges helmet, afterwards we heard the rifle. That was when we knew we were in trouble. We had no idea where the shot came from or how far away they really were. All we knew was that we were sitting ducks if we stayed still. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_36">
		<text>"Grenades are not cheap, but they can mean the difference between life and death. Thermite is my preference when it comes to clearing rooms." He whispered this as he casually tossed a grenade through the window of the building next door. The smell of burning flesh still haunts me. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_37">
		<text>"My grandad fought in the big one. Old man taught me whats best for the world, but you are one of the good ones, guess he was wrong about only dead ones being good." "Wow, so was mine! He was a commissar and carried around this PPSH. He's going to be happy when I show him another tally on the stock." </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_38">
		<text>The man stood up after he crested the hill of the grassy field. As he did 3 helicopters passed him at full speed. "May god's mercy be with you" he said as he continued onwards. "I have made enough to retire early I just wish I the friends I made in the Zone would have come with me."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_39">
		<text>It was nice to rest by the campfire and for the first time in weeks and actually relax. We had been on the run for so long I forgot what it felt like to sleep for more than 4 hours. I lit up the fatty I had been saving since before our trip. Seeing the excitement on their faces in that moment made me forget the horrors we had just endured. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_40">
		<text>I remember when the Zone was something only locals came to. Now it seems like everyone, and their brother wants to make their claim in the zone. Hell, even the United Nations are trying to get a piece of the action now. If you ask me these foreigners need to go back home we were better off without them! </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_41">
		<text>Forester has been here since before the incident, before the Zone, back when this forest was peaceful and a place to enjoy visiting. The Zone even gave him the gift of scouting perfect paths for taking such good care of the forest. Now the old man fixes weapons and waits for the Zone to "claim its price" for his gift. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_42">
		<text>What they don’t tell you when you come here is how much you will miss the little things you took for granted. Wind blowing across your face, the smell of flowers, and the one I miss the most is the seeing faces as they pass by. These gask masks keep us alive yes, but they take away so much of our humanity. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_43">
		<text>Whatever happened to Strider and the rest of his group? I heard he started his own faction of Monolith soldiers who "woke up?" Man your guess is as good as mine. I have never even heard the guy, but if I see someone in Monolith armor I am not going to check if they are "awake" or not, I am shooting. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_44">
		<text>Why is it these eggheads wants us to bring these "precious artefacts" but won't give us a decent detector to find the damn things! Well maybe you should stop expecting things to given to you and buy one yourself. There is no guarantee you will come back so why invest in a decent detector when you will buy one yourself if you live long enough. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_45">
		<text>I know we are not supposed to ask, but is everything alright? Your shipments for ammo and explosives have doubled and you ordered enough guns to arm a literal army. The man did not say a word simply handed the briefcase over loaded with rubles. When he walked away I heard him whisper something... some shit about a monolith. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_46">
		<text>Yeah, I can fix that I used to be an engineer outside the zone. "What the hell brought you here?" asked the man. Well, I used to be a father, but some thugs killed my daughter and I just snapped. I saw red and they next thing I knew they were bodies and what used to be people everywhere. I don’t remember much just calmly sitting next to some poor kid as he was bleeding out while I read my daughters favorite bedtime story. </text> 
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_47">
		<text>I miss him every day. I still haven't gone artefact hunting since his death. It just hurts too much to think about how he would get so excited when we saw that dot on the detector. I buried him with our detector, his wife’s photo and his PKM. I carry his patch in my pocket to remind myself it can all end in an instant. God, I miss him why did you have to take him and not me? He was such a good stalker. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_48">
		<text>Okay let me get this straight. You want me to go into not just Monolith territory, but Limansk of all places. Kill a Monolith preacher who has a modified Norosog and come back with his book? You are out of your mind if you think I am doing this for under less than 6 figures in USD. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_49">
		<text>There we were pinned down at the pump station. Renegades all around and bullets flying everywhere. I had just watched the guy next to me get mowed down the second he raised his head to lay covering fire. That is when we heard it. Explosion after explosion followed by the sound of our once mortal enemy coming to our aid. Some soldiers from Freedom heard our S.O.S. and came to our aid. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_50">
		<text>If you think the Monolith are nuts let me tell you about this group called Sin. These Sinners are nutjobs that think the Zone should consume the entire world and that it is the greatest thing to happen to mankind. They say embracing the Zone as a gift is the path to enlightenment. Me personally I say the world would be better off without this place. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_51">
		<text>The click of the Geiger Counter went from an occasional click to a constant note and what seemed to appear out of thin air was now floating before them. "This is the score we needed boys it’s time to go to Yantar and then finally leave the Zone."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_52">
		<text>The Krug Antenna Complex used to be a Bloodsucker lair. A stalker came though one day and poisoned the little bastards making sure they would never be a threat again. Some say he was actually an undercover soldier, but I don’t believe it. They would have no reason to be all the way in Zaton. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_53">
		<text>I remember when Meadows used to be a peaceful place where you could relax for the day. Stalkers and Bandits did not think it was worth their time going through there. I wish it was still that way, if it’s not bandits trying to take over the factory it seems like mutants are wanting to build a new nest there. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_54">
		<text>There I was hidden in a bush. Mercs were apparently after the same document that I was. It had been such a long standoff, but little did they suspect I happened to always carry an IED with me. I heard a loud bang and by the time the dust settled I had jumped out the window and ran. I didn’t expect a horde of zombies going towards the explosion though. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_55">
		<text>Damn cheap ammo how the hell do you manage to jam a Kalashnikov! I swear to god if we make it out of this firefight I am going to bash that fat bastards face in for this one. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_56">
		<text>While often an overlooked profession couriers are one of the most essential and well-respected jobs in the Zone. I met a few guys back at 100 Rads who used to run supplies back and forth for Beard and his tea brewing business. Those guys retired after just a year on the job. "So why didn’t they leave?" They did the guys own a buisness selling shoes now in Paris now. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_57">
		<text>WHOA! Cool night Vision bro I can’t believe it’s not green or just black and white like you always see. Yeah, it is nice, but it is not perfect. It has a more limited view and is not as bright as FLIR or the old-fashioned stuff, but it works better than just about anything else in close mid to close range. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_58">
		<text>Stop closing your eye when you are aiming down site. If you keep an eye closed, you limit your view significantly and you never know when someone or something is going to try and sneak up on you. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_59">
		<text>It's a trap! That was all I had time to say before the rookie walked up to an injured Monolith soldier. Within an instant there was a loud boom and the stalker standing in front of me was nothing more than a fine red mist covering the room. I was launched out of the building onto the roof of a car parked down on the road. My back still hurts, but I'm still alive. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_60">
		<text>Do you think there will be signal out here? The tourist pulled out his phone to take a picture for social media and that was the exact moment that I knew Rookie Village was turning into a tourist trap. When we ran into a pack of zombies, I let one grab him before jamming my Ka-Bar into its head. He needed a decent reality check. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_61">
		<text>Traders in the food business such as Barkeep, Beard, and even Sid managed to destabilize the food market within the zone to the point it is cheaper to buy imported food than it is to cook for yourself. These traders are also the only ones with connections with wholesale food prices in the Zone. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_62">
		<text>I want to meet the genius who thought of building the Sarcophagus. It was great in practice, trying to contain radiation levels so it would not spread, but all they managed to successfully do was give the Monolith a literal bunker to plan attacks from. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_63">
		<text>I met a stalker one time who repurposed a bullet casing into a lighter. I tried to buy the thing off him and even jokingly offered to bring him a casing of my own for him to make another, but he refused. I saw him not too long ago in Yanov. He said he was on his way to the outskirts via the underground tunnel. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_64">
		<text>What I wouldn’t give for a warm shower and a nice cold soda. This place takes such an emotional toll on you that often times it has you neglecting physical health as well. "Here, hopefully this will help even a little." an older stalker places a strange artefact near the man’s drink and within moments the drink began to chill. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_65">
		<text>The Duty soldiers were firing nonstop. It was to the point that smoke had gotten so thick they could no longer see, and gunpowder’s distinct smell was far and wide throughout Rostock. something was wrong; a pack of wild dogs is one thing, but these were zombies driven by nothing, but an unstoppable hunger. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_66">
		<text>The stalker slowly took off his mask. The sound of the Geiger Counter had faded and in his final moments he felt a strange sense of calm and peace. Clutching a photo of his family he whispered, "I can’t wait to see you again."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_67">
		<text>"you are a real piece of shit you know that?" The Stalker with his hands and feet bound together like a hog was tossed down a flight of stairs. "Don’t worry we will keep you alive, but just remember Owl always gets people to talk sooner or later. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_68">
		<text>The sight of red and green tracers filled the night sky. "How many of them are there he screamed?" How the hell would I know just keep shooting. The stalemate between Duty and Freedom in Truck Cemetery had reached a boiling point and all out warfare had begun. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_69">
		<text>Three helicopters flew in rapidly touching down to drop off the infantry inside. The platoon had no idea that they were walking right into an ambush. A mole in their unit had informed their allies about the upcoming attack. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_70">
		<text>Duty had arranged a meeting with some local thugs. A deal was made where bandits would take a bribe form Duty members in order to stop launching ambushes against them in exchange for reoccurring payments. They knew they would all be prosecuted if this was discovered, but they did not care enough people had died at Garbage. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_71">
		<text>It was a routine mission. We were to go and take down a pack of wild animals that had been giving the local eggheads trouble. We had never been to Yantar, but everyone had heard of the Miracle Machine. We did not know the hallucinations it caused or the fact the place is crawling with Snorks. I gained a new level of respect for those eggheads. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_72">
		<text>Professor Herman looked at the glowing object with pure amazement. He had given up hope on it ever existing, but there it was staring at him. "Oasis is real? How is this even possible? Maybe this will get me that Nobel Prize and better funding for this project." He thought to himself while still in astonishment. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_73">
		<text>Kopachy village is easy money Alex, I'm telling you. Everyone is so afraid of the radiation they forget about the free loot the zombies are carrying. If we go there I promise you we will both return alive and much wealthier. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_74">
		<text>Things were not always this bad Owl said. A long time ago a stalker came through here and seriously helped thin out the mutant population. Sadly, that was a long time ago and it seems that the mutants are reproducing in record numbers now. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_75">
		<text>It seems with every year more and more stalkers are coming into the Zone. There used to be just a couple hundred of us roaming around and it felt so connected. Now it seems like thousands pour in every year and it has done nothing but anger the zone. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_76">
		<text>As I stood there, I had the idea to turn around and look back just one last time. I had been here for so long I do not know if I can make it on the outside again, but my time was up here. I left without any major riches, or priceless possessions. Instead, I leave here rich with memories and stories to tell my grandkids when I see them. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_77">
		<text>"There has been enough bloodshed today and I am tired of seeing you kids dying." The medic was an old man who had served as a combat medic in Afghanistan. He did not care what faction the soldiers were from he helped anyone who he could save and performed last rites to the ones too far gone while giving them morphine. Stalkers from all over bring him medical supplies as a thank you for his actions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_78">
		<text>Butcher is considered a legend in the southern parts of the zone. When he came in Garbage was crawling with mutants and the area was inhospitable to stalkers. I don’t believe the stories some tell that he cleared it by himself, but he has many stories and even more info on mutant hunting. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_79">
		<text>"There is a guard that will let you through just follow me I have made hundreds of people into stalkers this year alone and its only May." The squad all got their wallets out and handed the soldier the requested payment for passage through and after a short hike they were now in Cordon. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_80">
		<text>"You are looking for explanations and reasoning where there is none! Now shut up and shoot anything that comes through that door" Mathias said as the hinges of the vault door began to rattle and the door started to buckle. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_81">
		<text>It’s the little things that still remind us that we are human. We need to remember that here in the Zone. A life of killing and trying to survive can make us forget that behind that mask is another person the same as me and you. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_82">
		<text>You know what the difference between war and Hell? Only the deserving end up in Hell. With that being said the difference between war and the Zone is men are the only monsters in war. "See, this shit right here is why everyone started calling you philosopher" said the other stalker visibly confused at the campfire. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_83">
		<text>I am starting to worry about you and your... problem. "Yeah, I’ve got a problem! I am stuck here in the Zone, and I am all out of booze! Now make yourself useful and bring me some more beer." the drunken stalker said while smashing an empty beer bottle into the wall. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_84">
		<text>Did you hear about the squad that ran out of ammo and charged into combat with knives and axes? It was a total bloodbath there was limbs everywhere and blood was literally running down the street. If the zone keeps expanding is this the fate, we are all destined for? </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_85">
		<text>"It’s dangerous to go alone take this." the stalker said after handing his friend a clip for his SKS. "I swear if you do one more shitty video game quote, I'm going to smack you." the other replied with a smile on his face and a chuckle afterwards. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_86">
		<text>There are no gods or kings here in the Zone only men... oh and Hip, but she won’t leave Rookie Village so does she really count? </text>

		<text>You would think that the animals in the Zone would attempt to hibernate, but just like the rest of the Zone the rules of nature do not apply to this place. When Winter comes it does get a little easier though as Bloodsuckers still leave footprints. </text>

		<text>If anyone ever says there is not a symphony to war, they have never seen combat. The sound of machine guns firing becomes rhythmic with boots stomping across the battlefield, knives tearing through armor and into flesh. It all begins to sound like music created by the devil’s orchestra. </text>

		<text>Lukash can I ask a question? "What's up bro?" What’s the price of a mile? “huh?” We have been fighting for so long and gained no ground. I have been with Freedom from the beginning, and I must have seen well over a thousand men march to their death, it’s to the point I don’t even try to learn their names anyone there’s no point. So again, I ask what’s the price of a mile? "I... I think it’s time we negotiate peace with the mercs" Lukash said thus ending the war between the two. </text>

		<text>The stalker leaned down beside another who was sitting on the ground sobbing profusely. "It's okay you did what you had to do it was your life or his." the stalker took his mask off, reached into his bag and handed the crying stalker a piece of chocolate. "Don't let anyone fool you we have all been in your shoes and any who says it was easy is a damn liar. You will never get over it, but it will get easier I promise."</text>

		<text>I left the zone 10 years ago, but it still haunts me. Every night I dream about that fateful evening and how I cheated death. I still don’t understand how I managed to survive, but it left a mark that will never heal. The other day the neighbors must have gotten a new gun because the shots sounded so close. My wife managed to snap me out of it and when I came to, I was hiding behind the house clutching a stick like it was my rifle. </text>

	<string id="ls_tip_92">
		<text>There is a common misconception that there are only a few hundred in the zone. When stalkers first register with the network it gives an estimated number, but there are 7 billion people on this rock. If you think for even one moment, there are less than a thousand people in the exclusion zone on any given day you are simply a fool. </text>

		<text>We called him Texas because he would never shut the hell up about how things were back home. He would go on and on about life "out west in the desert" and how he was going to bring an artefact home after he stuck it rich. Dumbass couldn’t shoot straight to save his life, but we loved having him around and he knew how to cook. I miss that guy; I can’t believe he lived long enough to see his dream come true. </text>

	<string id="ls_tip_94">
		<text>We have been defending the barrier for hours the machine guns have all overheated and munitions are running low. They just keep coming and they don’t care if they live or die. "Shit I’m out of ammo... Brothers smoke an extra one for me tonight!" The stalker was a bomb maker and when we saw him pull the pin on a grenade, we knew the end result. He went out in one hell of a blaze and the crater in the road is where those zombies shot him down. He saved our lives that morning. </text>

		<text>A long time ago I heard that war never changes, but I don’t believe it. My dad fought in both Chechnyan wars. The first time our village praised him as a hero and made sure we were fed and taken care of. The second war we were disgraced. The village elder shunned us and called my dad a failure. Dad wasn’t okay before that day. Whatever he saw in that one changed him. We came here exiled to the Zone like some filthy animals, but here we got a new start. I’m doing my best to take care of him and we are going to fix a house in Meadows soon. </text>

		<text>When the Colonel walked into the room, we could tell that something was not right. It was just the way he was acting, and you could cut the tension in the air with a knife. Nobody saw it coming when he pulled his Makarov out and shot our Staff sergeant twice in the head. "Does anyone else feel like selling guns to stalkers now?" </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_97">
		<text>You don’t really believe there is an alien rock in the center of the Zone, do you? "Have you looked around lately? No God would allow this place to exist and there is no way something from this Earth could have brought the Zone upon us! I am going with them, and we will figure it out for ourselves now you can come along or stay here I don’t care." I am glad I did not go with him...</text>

		<text>"Get down and whatever you don't stop moving." The sniper had us dialed in and was laying down suppressive fire, but Pavlov did not care. "These fools think I haven’t been shot at before, but I’ve been a soldier since I was 6!" Pavlov was not his real name, but nobody knew how to say his real name. Poor guy told me once he was a child soldier who used to live in a place called "The Congo." Apparently, he fled for the zone and learned Russian while he was here.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_99">
		<text>"Stop aiming for the head aim for the base of the neck and you will connect more shots." Hunting people was never something I wanted trained in. In fact, I used to be a pacifist but during the occupation our people were being round up and slaughtered like cattle and any opposition were executed publicly. I miss home, but I can never go back. I still dream of leaving this place and helping others instead of taking their lives. </text>

		<text>There is an old wise tale to never drink Vodka form a dead stalkers bag. It’s supposed to be bad luck, but booze changes hands so much in the zone there is no telling how many times a stalker has died with the bottle you hold right now. </text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_101">
		<text>It’s not just Russia or the UN launching special operations into the Zone. SAS, GIGN, hell I have even seen Blackwater agents come through Dead City either looking for info, ammo, or needing a medic. I pulled some serious strings to get a card reader set up in the zone, but anything they need they are always willing to pay a good price for and we have built a solid reputation with these organizations.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_102">
		<text>It is not every day a Stalker gets the name "Red," but when they do you know their fate will be bad. I remember Red coming to the zone. He was here to make money for his daughters chemo and maybe find a cure. Sakharov told him there was hope, but it would be dangerous and involved a trip north near the CNPP. Three months went by where he was missing in action until last night when I saw him in Limansk wearing Monolith armor...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_103">
		<text>We called him butterfingers because he could never hold onto anything. If you needed to loose something you made sure to give it to him. I remember one time seeing him coming back to the warehouse with with the gun Screw had just fixed before his trip. The barrel was literally melted and so heavily damaged it would not fire. Apparently he managed to drop it into a fruit punch and grabbed what was left of it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_104">
		<text>I had just enough money left to either buy ammo or a meal for the night. The hunger pains are horrible and it can make aiming hard at times, but I would rather be hungry and able to hunt my next meal then be out of ammo and hope a fellow stalker is nice enough to share with you.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_105">
		<text>Let me tell you a little secret a I learned the hard way. Strontium which was in the reactor has a metallic taste and Plutonium tastes sweet. If you ever find yourself without your Geiger Counter and start to getting strange tastes you are standing in a radiation pocket.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="Ls_tip_106">
		<text>I think I miss fishing the most from my life outside the zone. I never cared for it before, but just the thought of being next to some radiation free water and not a worry in the world other than cathcing some food sounds like heaven to me now.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_107">
		<text>Rats themselves are nothing more then a pest. Even when there are a few of them a good kick to their head will take them out, but when they travel in packs they can eat a stalker alive... I'll never forget taking a job down in one of the labs some loner thought he could clear the place by himself I guess. Those rats picked him clean. All that was left was his patch and pieces of clothing.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_108">
		<text>"You know those things will kill you right?"... Seriously? There are anomalies that can kill you almost instantly, radioative air in lethal doses, mutants that can chew the flesh off of bone, and psy storms that can literally fry your brain and you are worried about my having a smoke?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_109">
		<text>"Do you believe in ghosts?" I think it was becaused I was tired, but I could have swore a few days ago I saw one in outskits. It was a Monolith, I almost shot him, he was on the ground praying and then he seemed to fade into thin air. "It wasn’t because you were tired, I saw him too."</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_110">
		<text>I will never forget my first day in the zone. I was so hungry I was ready to eat just about anything. The boys and I decided to make some flesh bacon. Oh my god do those things stink to a rookie stalker; I almost threw up in my mask. With that being said damn does it taste good!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_111">
		<text>While most are here because they pissed off someone higher in the ranks and they tend to be as crooked as a politician dont underestimate the military. Ive lost friends from classic pincer traps. Just because they are here does not mean they are not well trained.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_112">
		<text>I still can't believe that crazy old bastard is alive! You would think a man his age would have bit the dust by now up North, but he sent me a messge a few days ago talking about another sucessful Chimera hunt.</text>

	<string id="ls_tip_113">
		<text>Did you hear about that contract killer at the Freedom base? "The one who watched his friends get killed by Duty?" Yeah that guy! man you will never believe it, but he left. He packed his stuff up early this morning and Garry is escorting him south through Red Forest... I am going to miss that guy.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_114">
		<text>He was completely unaware. I laid there with my crosshairs aimed at the base of his neck like I was trained to. "Squeeze the trigger, just a quick squeeze and its over. You've done this countless times before what makes this diffrent?" I don't know why, but I could not watch. I closed my eyes and squeezed the trigger; I heard my PDA beep a few moments afterwards and knew the job was done.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_115">
		<text>They told us it was 3.6 roentgens per hour. Years later we would discover it was around 5.6 per second in some areas. Why I decided to come back here I will never know, maybe I just have a death wish? Either way that's enough talking, place the scanner by that Fruit Punch already so we can get out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_116">
		<text>You stupid fucking idiot why didn't you tell us you couldnt read a map when we gave it to you! Why are you laughing huh? We are literally lost in the North and in case you didn't realize we are not exactly welcomed by the locals. "Cëàâà Ìîíîëèòó!" That was all he had to say. I don't know what that means, but what I do know was he led us into an ambush.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_117">
		<text>"You think I can hit that helicopter from here?" If you miss we are guaranteed dead so don't. "Okay then go hide in that house and when I hit it your buying drinks tonight." I have never been that drunk before! That dumbass was shot to pieces before he could get to cover, I sold what gear I could salvage and bought drinks with it. He did hit the helicopter by the way.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_118">
		<text>As we got closer to the fire the smell of burning flesh became stronger and stronger. There was nothing left, but charred bodies and rubble scattered across the factory complex. Meadows used to be a peaceful place, there used to be some stalkers who hung out here trying to start a new life. Who did this and why? A once cheerful place had become just another sad story of life in the zone.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_119">
		<text>"That is over a %300 profit for your fat ass! What you don't think we know about your prices? I don't know if you need that extra money to keep that bald head of your waxed or what, but you can either change your prices or find a new dealer." Sidorovich, knowing he couldn't turn the offer down, reluctantly made a new offer.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_120">
		<text>"Kahn ich eine Zigarette haben?" What? "Kahn ich eine Zigarette haben?" Again, I speak English. These new guys from the citadel did not speak a lick of English it seems, but so far they seem to handle themselves well in a fight so maybe they will live longer than the last batch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ls_tip_121">
		<text>"This church is beautiful! I can't imagine how it looked..." Quiet, do you hear that? "No." Exactly now stop talking. Clear Sky is going to expect us to be at the church and will be watching for us by that tower. Now I am sick of this broken ass rifle, I need something new, and I know that patrol will have quite a few new toys if we pull this off.</text>
