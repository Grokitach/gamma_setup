		<text>A strange and high-tech device created by Pr. Sakharov. The Artefacts Melter (AM) allows the manipulation of artefacts materials. This tool is fuelled using the energy hold by artefacts, which can be acquired and stored for further uses by melting them. The Artefacts Melter can also strengthen artefacts of the same kind, or even fuse artefacts of different kind to generate new ones. The chemical and physical processes at work are not fully understood yet. Recent researches are pointing towards the ability of the tool to harness the Noosphere's power. Other experiments showed that the AM only works in the Zone. These findings quickly prompted most high ranked stalkers to acquire such a tool in order to create stronger and more expensive artefacts for the black market or their own use.\n \n
		    %c[d_orange]Characteristics of the Artefacts Melter Operating System (AMOS) v2.15a installed on this device:\n \n
		    %c[d_orange] - Artefacts melting: Hold the secure key (Left alt) and move the Artefacts Melter over any artefact to melt it and refill the AM tank by 10% (1 use).\n
		    %c[d_orange] - Artefacts empowering: Choose "empower artifacts" in the AMOS main menu to combine artefacts of the same kind to strenghten them.\n
		    %c[d_orange] - Artefacts fusion: Choose "fuse artifacts" in the AMOS main menu and open the recipe sub-menu. AMOS contains already known and *secure* artefacts combinations. Using unknown combination could lead to dramatic events. Random combinations are thus not allowed by the AMOS.\n
		    %c[d_orange] - AMOS has built-in security protocols to avoid any malfunction. If the tool refuses to work, be sure that the AM tank holds more than 10% (1 use) of its total capacity.\n

		<text>This anomalous activity detector is an updated version of the Bear detector and is able to detect all known artefacts signatures just like the Svarog or Veles detectors. This upgraded Bear is especially appreciated by stalkers hunting artefacts during the night since its simple display is compatible with night vision googles.\n \n
